▌Description

The script performs the following actions:

1.  Prompts for Input:  The input() function displays the message "Enter your name " on the screen and waits for the user to type in their name and press Enter.
2.  Stores Input: The entered name is stored in the variable x.
3.  Prints Greeting: The script then uses the print() function to display the message "hello " followed by the value stored in the variable x (the user's name).


▌How to Run the Script

1.  Save the code: Save the code as a Python file (e.g., greeting.py).
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  Run the script: Type python greeting.py and press Enter.

▌Expected Output

The script will first display:
Enter your name

After you enter your name (e.g., "AfroSec") and press Enter, the script will display:
hello AfroSec

▌Explanation of Key Elements

•   input("Enter your name "): This function displays the text "Enter your name " in the console and waits for the user to type something in and press Enter.  The value the user types is then returned as a string.

•   x = ...: This assigns the string returned by the input() function to the variable x.

•   print("hello " + x):  This function prints a string to the console.  It concatenates (joins together) the string "hello " with the value of the variable x (which contains the user's name).

▌Notes

•   The input() function always returns a string, even if the user enters a number.  If you need to treat the input as a number, you'll need to convert it using int() or float().
•   This is a very basic example of user input. More complex scripts might validate the input or use it in more sophisticated ways.
