Simple String Methods for Data Manipulation
This document covers some simple string methods to manipulate text in Python.
1. .upper()
This method turns the text into ALL CAPS. Great for shouting!
Example code:
name = "AfroSec"
print(name.upper())  # Output: "AFROSEC"
2. .lower()
This method turns the text into all lowercase. Perfect for a softer tone.
Example code:
name = "LONEWOLF"
print(name.lower())  # Output: "lonewolf"
3. .title()
This method makes the first letter of each word uppercase. Itâ€™s like giving your text a title!
Example code:
name = "afrosec"
print(name.title())  # Output: "Afrosec"
Recap
- **.upper()** = ALL CAPS!
- **.lower()** = all lowercase
- **.title()** = Capitalize each word's first letter
